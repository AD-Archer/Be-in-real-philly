# History of Philadelphia 

Penn was granted a vast tract of land in North America by King Charles II as a means of repaying a debt owed to Penn’s father. That land ultimately became Pennsylvania, along with the many cities that now reside within it, including Philadelphia. Numerous colonists pledged their allegiance to Penn, recognizing him as the founder of Pennsylvania. Later, Penn journeyed up the banks of the Delaware River and encountered land that, as previously mentioned, was inhabited by the Lenape people. The Lenape were gradually being displaced due to the encroachment of European colonization. This expansion brought with it significant challenges, including the spread of deadly diseases carried by the Europeans, which severely weakened the Lenape and forced them to begin relocating. In an effort to foster peace, Penn purchased the land and sought to create a peaceful colony for all. He negotiated a peace treaty with the Lenape chief in what is now known as ‘Fishtown,’ marking the beginning of our cherished Philadelphia ( Greek for “brotherly love”).
