# William Penn, His influence on Philadelphia\!

## Background

	\-  William Penn born October 24th 1644 (old dating system: October 16th 1644\) was an English writer, religious thinker, and influential Quaker who founded Pennsylvania during the British colonial era. He was known for his advocacy of democracy and kind nature, seeing that he made multiple peace treaties with the Lenape, a native american group who settled down in modern day Pennsylvania prior to European settlement.   
Penn was given a large piece of North American land by King Charles II as a way of paying off debt he owed Penn’s father, that land obviously went on to become Pennsylvania and the many cities that reside in it , including Philadelphia\! Many colonists pledged their allegiance to Penn and pointed him as the Founder of Pennsylvania.
