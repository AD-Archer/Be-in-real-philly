## Inspiration

We wanted to create a site that lets people explore Philly through maps in a way that feels more connected to the local community. Whenever I visit New York, I only see the big tourist spots like Times Square, but I never get to experience the real New York, the way my friends from there do. Thatâ€™s why I wanted to build a project that gives people the chance to experience Philly the way locals do.

## What It Does

The Philly Way showcases multiple interactive maps, highlighting places that locals love as well as some hidden gems. It includes trivia, local slang, and hidden mini-games, allowing users to experience Philly from anywhere. You can use our West Philly map to virtually walk the streets and explore notable spots.

## How We Built It

We built **The Philly Way** using **Leaflet.js** for interactive maps, along with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the site's structure and design. The maps feature custom markers with pop-ups that provide descriptions, links, and directions.

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was locking the map boundaries to focus on specific areas. We also needed to balance including enough points of interest while keeping the site easy to navigate.

## Accomplishments

We successfully created a digital experience that feels local and community-driven, with functional maps providing directions and useful links. The personalized descriptions make each location a true piece of Philly culture.

## What We Learned

We gained valuable experience working with **Leaflet.js**, embedding pop-up information, and connecting real-world data to provide useful links. Adding personal touches significantly enhances user engagement.

## What's Next

We plan to expand the maps to cover more neighborhoods, add more local trivia, and create a way for users to contribute their own favorite spots. We aim to turn The Philly Way into a full-scale app for walking tours and challenges.
